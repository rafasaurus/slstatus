Requirements
------------
Currently slstatus works on FreeBSD, Linux and OpenBSD.
In order to build slstatus you need the Xlib header files.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (slstatus is installed into the
/usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install slstatus (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install


Running slstatus
----------------
See the man page for details.


Configuration
-------------
slstatus can be customized by creating a custom config.h and (re)compiling the
source code. This keeps it fast, secure and simple.


Todo
----
Cleaning up the whole codebase it the goal before thinking about a release.
